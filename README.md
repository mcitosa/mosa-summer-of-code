# MOSA Summer of Code

## Guidelines
1. You are free to use whatever language(s) for the MOSA Summer of Code Project, and there is no limit on the number or type(s) of framework(s) you will adopt. But you should keep all your code in a single GitHub org or repo, so that it will be better organised for the purposes of evaluation.
2. You should use the recommended project README.md template and include this in your code to be submitted for the competition. 
3. While we encourage you to be creative, you should try to adhere to best practices in programming and solutions architecture in general.
